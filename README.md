# Bearing-fault-detection
This repository contains a machine learning program for detecting types of faults in bearings using vibration sensor data. The program is designed to process vibration data, prepare it for training, and then train a neural network model for fault classification.
File Data Preparation
Extracting File Path
The data preparation starts by extracting file paths for both normal and faulty bearing data. The code uses a specified base path and iterates through different RPM values to create a list of file paths.
